# ***Souls "Unsqueezed"***
Aspect Ratio and Performance Fixes for ***Dark Souls III*** _(PC)_

***Souls "Unsqueezed"*** is designed primarily to fix HUD scaling and aspect ratio problems in ***Dark Souls III*** that would otherwise involve modifying the game's executable or instructions. The game has an anti-cheat system that can easily detect if its code or memory has been modified, and makes other solutions impractical for online play.

This mod is no more intrusive than overclocking software you may already have running on your system and does not modify any of the game's memory. It only modifies a handful of Win32, D3D11 and DXGI API calls and is no more likely to cause a "softban" than the Steam overlay is.

Avoiding the wrath of anti-cheat means that I cannot modify as many things as I have in prior projects, but there is still ***a lot*** that can be done by altering D3D11 commands alone if the project generates enough interest.

**NOTE:** _The code is limited to `plugin_ds3.cpp` because this is an add-on to a much larger project._
>The source code for the parent project is in my [Special K repository](https://github.com/Kaldaien/SpecialK/). Compiling and distributing that project is complicated and I have not had time to simplify the process. If you wish to contribute to this project, you will have to contact me on Steam and I can walk you through getting that all done.
